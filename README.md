rs-w2c : Retroshare Chat Server
======

This is the source code for the Retroshare Chat Server PHP Frontend.


I am not the author. He has graciously allowed drBob to put in up in a repository so everyone can access it.
I added a frontpage and separated the translations from the code. 

There is a complete Installation Guide in INSTALL, please read that for details of how to set it up.

This code should work together with https://github.com/cavebeat/retroshare-chatserver 

Send me any improvements you make.
Pls send me any translations or Bugs. 

Thanks, cave.
