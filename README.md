rs-w2c : Retroshare Chat Server
======

This is the source code for the Retroshare Chat Server.


I am not the author. He has graciously allowed me to put in up in a repository so everyone can access it.


There is a complete Installation Guide in w2c/INSTALL, please read that for details of how to set it up.


Send me any improvements you make.


Thanks, drBob.
