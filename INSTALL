Chatserver changes in libretroshare
/build/retroshare/libretroshare/src/pqip3peermgr.cc
in p3peermgr.cc replace
setServicePermissionFlags(gpg_id,service_flags)
with 
setServicePermissionFlags(gpg_id,RS_SERVICE_PERM_NONE) 

servicepermissions for forums/channels are already disabled in chatserver.cpp - I think: 
if (!rsPeers->addFriend(sslId, gpgId, RS_SERVICE_PERM_DISCOVERY)) 
only Discovery is enabled 
just change RS_SERVICE_PERM_DISCOVERY to RS_SERVICE_PERM_NONE there 





We assume that you run Ubuntu or a Debian-like distribution.

1. Install the following packages:

		sudo apt-get install libgpgme11-dev libgpg-error-dev libupnp-dev libssl-dev libgnome-keyring-dev libbz2-dev libqt4-dev g++ libxss-dev subversion
	
2. Download the sources:

		svn co https://retroshare.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/retroshare/trunk retroshare

3. Modify the file ~/retroshare/retroshare-nogui/src/retroshare-nogui.pro. Uncomment the following line:
	
		CONFIG += introserver
	
4. Compile:

		cd ~/retroshare/libbitdht/src && qmake && make clean && make -j2
		cd ~/retroshare/openpgpsdk/src && qmake && make clean && make -j2
		cd ~/retroshare/libretroshare/src && qmake && make clean && make -j2
		cd ~/retroshare/retroshare-gui/src && qmake && make clean && make -j2
		cd ~/retroshare/retroshare-nogui/src && qmake && make clean && make -j2
		cp ~/retroshare/retroshare-gui/src/RetroShare ~/RetroShare
		cp ~/retroshare/retroshare-nogui/src/retroshare-nogui ~/retroshare-nogui

5. (Optional, recommanded) Create a GnuPG key with no password:

		gpg --gen-key
		
   Choose "(1) RSA and RSA (default)", with size 2048. DO NOT SET A PASSWORD!

6. Run RetroShare normally (launch the executable created in your home directory), and set up everything correctly.

7. Go to Options --> Security, and click "copy RetroShare link to clipboard". Save the result in a file named "hyperlink.txt", in your home folder.

8. Close RetroShare when setup is finished.

9. Start retroshare-nogui from the terminal:

		./retroshare-nogui

10. Copy the file "hyperlink.txt" in the folder ~/.retroshare/<sslid>/STORAGE/, and check that serverkey.txt contains your key and lobbyname.txt contains something like "Chat Server...".

11. At this point, it is a good idea to stop retroshare-nogui, and to make a backup of ~/.retroshare, for example:
		
		cp -r ~/.retroshare ~/.retroshare_clean
	
	Indeed, your server will have to handle hundreds of keys and suffer from the tests of new users: expect a lot of useless forums and channels. By doing this backup, you will be able to easily retrieve a clean installation.

1. Requirement
============================

You need any webserver running, like Apache of Lighttpd with PHP activated.

The following packages are needed:
- php5-gd     (necessary for captcha)
- php5-sqlite (we use a sqlite database)

You also need Securimage, which is already included in the package.


2. Install
============================

1. Copy the w2c folder in the root directory of your webserver, by default /var/www.

2. The folder w2c MUST be writable by the webserve:
		
		chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/w2c

3. In the config.ini file, a password for the management access and the path of your retroshare <sslid> folder. By default : 
		
		passwd_root = "asecretpass"
		nogui_path = "/home/<login>/.retroshare/<sslid>"
   
   This means that we suppose that all the files are in /var/www/w2c/

4. You should forbid access to the database (keys.db contains IP addresses). The archive already includes an .htaccess file containing the following:

		<Files keys.db>
		  Order allow,deny
		  Deny from all
		</Files>

   
   Be sure that in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default, you have AllowOverride All: 
   
        <Directory /var/www/>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride All
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
        </Directory>

   This works for Apache only. Please review the configuration of your webserver in others cases.

5. Create the database by launching data/create_db.php, so for example: http://www.yourwebsite/w2c/data/create_db.php 


3. Maintenance
============================

1. To have a list of the IP stored in the DB, visit:

		http://www.yourwebsite/w2c/data/manage_db.php?passwd_root=asecretpass&view=1
	
	Change "asecretpass" by the password chosen.

===============================================================	

You can simply run ./retroshare-nogui from the terminal. A Chat Lobby is automatically created, so that users can chat. For convenience, you can also use screen: screen -d -m -r "retro" ./retroshare-nogui.

Each time someone uses the web interface to add his key, it is copied in the folder "/home/login/.retroshare/<sslid>/NEWCERTS" and automatically added as a friend in RetroShare. He will be removed from the friend list 2 days later.

At the same time, the key of the server is displayed to the user:

	- using the retroshare:// link
	- using a simple box with the key in it (a button select the key)

The user is invited to join the Chat Lobby to meet other people.


Tips and tricks:
============================

1. If you defined a key without password, I suggest to make an infinite loop in case of crash. For example:
		
2. Regularly replace your .gnupg and .retroshare folders with the clean backups, because they'll become messy and the performances will drop drastically.

Example of run script:

	#!/bin/bash

	clean() {
		rm -rf ~/.retroshare
		cp -r ~/.retroshare_clean ~/.retroshare
	}

	while [ true ]; do
		./retroshare-nogui
		clean
	done

Example of cron job, to kill retroshare-nogui every 3 days at 4:00 AM:

	0 4 * * */3 killall retroshare-nogui
